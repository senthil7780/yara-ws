# yara-ws
workspace for yara exercise

Approach i took to complete the exercise

1) Setup an EC2 instance 
2) setup the security group for EC2 instance
3) setup the subnet
4) setup the route table
5) setup the subnet route table association
6) setup the vpc
7) setup the internet gateway
8) setup the EBS block volume
9) attach the volume to the EC2 instance
10) setup an elastic ip
11) create an elastic ip association
12) setup the installation script
13) use the file provisioner to copy the script
14) use the remote-exec to install jenkins along with java 8

while i am working i found out that my aws account was compromised and have to wait until i setup a new account.

until now the task took around 3.5 hrs without writing unit tests. I have not practised unit tests earlier hence i will take some time.
